# Brief
Genreates Tcp/Udp/SSL classes based around Qt network classes that
transmit/receive messages (defined by the protoc IDL) as Qt signals and slots.

# Overview
This project takes the functionality of Protocol Buffers,
https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers, and their ability to serialize
data writing and reading this data to Qt's provided socket functionality. The
generated network classes emit Qt signals when message structures are received,
and transmit these message structures when the messages are passed to their
slots. The overall result is a TcpSocket that behaves as a QTcpSocket however it
now handles data defined by the Protocol Buffer IDL rather than handling a
QByteArray. QTcpServer, QTcpSocket, and QUdpSocket are all currently supported.

# Currently tested systems
The written code was written strictly with the Qt library. This means that the
code should not require any modification in order to compile on Windows, Linux
or Apple operating systems. So far, only the following linux distributions have
been tested: Ubuntu, Redhat

# Prerequisits
For the code to build, Qt libraries including qmake is required as well as the
protoc binary from the Protocol Buffers project.
